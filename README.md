# compAutomata
compAutomata is an experimental implementation of a compositional, bottom-up, algorithm to translate LTLf and LDLf formulae to automata, based on the paper "Compositional Approach to Translate LTLf/LDLf into Deterministic Finite Automata". It is built using the FLLOAT library. For details see below.
This implementation is made for experimental purposes only and comes with no warranties.

# FLLOAT
FLLOAT (From LTLf and LDLf tO Automata) is a Java library for translating Linear-time Temporal Logic (LTL) and Linear Dynamic Logic (LDL) formulas with finite-trace semantics to automata, so as to perform satisfiability and validity reasoning tasks in the finite-trace setting. The tool also allows for exporting automata in the graphviz format as well as providing the traditional automata operations through the jautomata library (determinization, intersection, negation, trimming and so on).
FLLOAT can be found at https://github.com/RiccardoDeMasellis/FLLOAT
